# collection of code transforms

My personal collection of transforms for a variety of projects.

Probably not very useful for anyone to actually use, but perhaps a good
reference on how to use `ts-morph` to refactor typescript code at scale.

## usage

0. Install dependencies with `pnpm install`.
1. Update `./src/index.ts` to import the script you want to run.
2. Run `pnpm start`.
